# Kenya's Access to Water and Sanitation Analysis and Visualization - Census 2019
This repository visualizes Kenya's access to water and sanitation based on the latest (2019) census data conducted by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS). 

I decided to conduct this analysis and visualization in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, given that one of the most advocated ways of coronavirus prevention is the washing of hands with soap and running water. I intially started with our two main entry points i.e., Nairobi and Mombasa Counties but will soon update the code with other counties. 

### Mombasa and Nairobi Counties
For these two counties , I generated pie charts and a horizontal stacked bar. I shrunk the data so as to reduce the variables to improve the visualizations. Additionally, I defined a function that ensured that the shrunk data didn't have much difference statistically as compared to the raw data percentages. Some interesting points:
- Only 52% of Nairobi County residents have access to piped water to their place of residence i.e, either their dwelling or plot. 
- 45% Percent of Mombasa County residents depend on water vendors as the main source of drinking water. 
- A whooping 71% of Mombasa County residents lack access to piped water to their residence i.e., either their dwelling or plot.
